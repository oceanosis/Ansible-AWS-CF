# Ufuk Dumlu - 10th Nov 17
# AWS tasks are run 'locally'
# Authentication details should be passed in as arguments or exported in the shell before running this playbook
# Ideally they should be stored in Hashicorp's 'Vault'
# e.g.
# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=''
# export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=''
# For Webserver Setup, ssh agent will be used so that app will be installed
# eval $(ssh-agent) && ssk-add -k AAA.pem
# Finally, run with `ansible-playbook aws.yml`
